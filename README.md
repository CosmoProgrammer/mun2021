# IPC Website 

In the International Press Corps (IPC) of a Model United Nations (MUN), delegates are tasked with reporting on the various events and procedures going on in the rest of the MUN. Normally, the reporters are marked on three things. A Report, an OpEd and the Press Conference performance. Conventionally, the Reports and OpEds were all sent to the Chair by mail. However, this system faced multiple issues:
* Lack of Public Exposure: The reports were only available to the chair. However, the Press are highly popular among the other delegates and even the staff, who all excitedly gther whenever a press conference is about to start. They often requested to read the articles written by the Press and the Chair had to manually forward the reports to all of them.
* Inconsistent Article Submissions: The reporters had no organized platform to send and keep track of their articles, resulting in them often sending it to the wrong mail, missing the deadline etc
* Lack of Cross-Committee Awareness: Although the staff were often able to make time to view a press conference, the other delegates were always busy with their own committees. They are rarely aware of what is going on elsewhere, and even though there is a source already present, they have no proper access to the articles.

## Objectives

Thus, the IPC Website was designed to:

* Create a centralized platform where the reporters could upload all their articles.
* Ensure restricted access so that the reporters could only upload articles for the committee they have been assigned.
* Increase accessibility by ensuring that everyone involved in the MUN and even those not involved in the MUN are kept updated about the going ons.
* Enhance the overall engagement of the MUN by making sure that the spectators, staff and delegates are all entertained and kept up-to-date.
